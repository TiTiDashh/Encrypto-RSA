a simple text encryptor with RSA.
If you do not have a public and/or private key, touch the "Random Key" button to generate the public and private key, If you already have a public or private key and you try to generate one, it will ask you if you want to continue in case you accidentally touch the generate key button.
to download the program you have to download the files Encrypto RSA.py and Ul.zip then unzip Ul.zip, put it in the same folder as Ecrypto RSA.py and run Encrypto RSA.py
